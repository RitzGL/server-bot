# Discord Bot Prototype

This is a repository for a discord bot prototype. 

The bot will run in node.js.

Functionality yet to be determined.

## Ideas

1. Given a string, search the MDN for the resource name matching that string.
2. Given a command, return images of command's name. ie !dog returns picture of dog.
3. Responses to determined user messages. 
4. Responses to determined emojis sent in a single message.
